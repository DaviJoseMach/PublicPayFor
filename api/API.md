# PayFor API Documentation

## What is a REST API?

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an interface that enables communication between systems using HTTP protocols. REST APIs are commonly used to transfer data, providing a lightweight and efficient mechanism for exchanging information between clients and servers.

## How Does the PayFor API Work?

The PayFor API operates by retrieving gateway information from our database. This data is stored and processed on our server. The API then sends pre-processed and optimized data to the front-end, allowing the application to display it seamlessly to users.

This approach ensures that only relevant, formatted data is shared, reducing overhead and improving application performance.
